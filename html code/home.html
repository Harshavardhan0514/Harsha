                MyGov platform is a unique path breaking initiative which was launched on July 26, 2014 by none other than the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi. It is a unique first of its kind participatory governance initiative involving the common citizen at large. The idea of MyGov brings the government closer to the common man by the use of online platform creating an interface for healthy exchange of ideas and views involving the common citizen and experts with the ultimate goal to contribute to the social and economic transformation of India. In its short span of existence till date, MyGov platform has been more than successful in keeping the citizens engaged on important policy issues and governance, be it Clean Ganga, Girl Child Education, Skill Development and Healthy India to name a few. There is no doubt that this platform has made inroads in diminishing the gap which has traditionally existed between the citizen and the government.

MyGov platform has become a key part of the policy and decision making process of the country. Where the platform has been able to provide the citizens a voice in the governance process of the country and create grounds for the citizens to become stakeholders not only in policy formulation and recommendation bit but also implementation through actionable tasks. Given the importance of this platform in transformation of India through participatory governance, the platform has been constantly undergoing upgrades to ensure an enhanced level of user experience. The major attributes of MyGov includes Discussion, Tasks, Talks, Polls and Blogs on various groups based on the diverse governance and public policy issues.

MyGov has more than 9.5 Million users who contribute their ideas through discussions and also participate through the various earmarked tasks. In addition to this the platform gets more than 10,000 posts per weeks on various issues which are analyzed and put together as suggestions for the concerned departments who are able to transform them into actionable agenda.

With these impressive numbers, one has to say this is just the beginning and there is a lot more to come on this platform in future. As mentioned by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, MyGov is an initiative which should culminate into a mass movement towards self-governance or ‘surajya’. As further progress is being made under the umbrella of Digital India, utilizing the technology to further revolutionalise the public service delivery and citizen engagement, MyGov platform is all set to become a key agent for this change taking inputs from the citizens, the ultimate beneficiary and leverage their collective feedback to improve policy change and implementation.
